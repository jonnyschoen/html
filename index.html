  <h1>This is a website example</h1>
  <h3>HTML is a fundamentable language to develope websites</h3>

    <h3>Why it is important</h3>
    <p>HTML is important because it is the backbone to every website. This website is pretty boring right now. This is because you need to combine it wih CSS to make it look pretty. Still, there are many things you can do with it. Here are some of them:
   <ul>
     <li>Lists</li>
       <li>Paragraphs</li>
     <li>Headings</li>
     <li>Horizontal Lines</li>
      </ul>

     <h3>How do you add color?</h3>
       <p>Color is easy to add. Unfortunatly, you can't add it directly from the HTML library. Instead, you need to learn a seperate coding language call CSS. Using CSS you can add color and customization to your web page! There are many colors you can add
         such as red, blue, green, teal, brown, and much, MUCH more!</p>
