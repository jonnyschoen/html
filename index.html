  <h1>This is a website example</h1>
  <h3>HTML is a fundamental language to develop websites</h3>
  <hr>
    <h3>Why it is important</h3>
    <p>HTML is important because it is the backbone to every website. This website is pretty boring right now. This is because you need to combine it wih CSS to make it look pretty. Still, there are many things you can do with it. Here are some of them:
   <ul>
     <li>Lists</li>
       <li>Paragraphs</li>
     <li>Headings</li>
     <li>Horizontal Lines</li>
      </ul>
   <hr>
     <h3>How do you add color?</h3>
       <p>Color is easy to add. Unfortunately, you can't add it directly from the HTML library. Instead, you need to learn a seperate coding language call CSS. Using CSS you can add color and customization to your web page! There are many colors you can add
         such as red, blue, green, teal, brown, and much, MUCH more!<br>Let's get started!</p>

  <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
  <p>Paragraphs are the main part of a website. They deliver the bulk of information and are SUPER IMPORTANT. For example,
  this is a paragraph.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><h1>Heading 1</h1></li>
    <li><h2>Heading 2</h2></li>
    <li><h3>Heading 3</h3></li>
    <li><h4>Heading 4</h4></li>
    <li><h5>Heading 5</h5></li>
