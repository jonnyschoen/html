  <h1>This is a website example</h1>
  <h3>HTML is a fundamental language to develop websites</h3>
  <hr>
    <h3>Why it is important</h3>
    <p>HTML is important because it is the backbone to every website. This website is pretty boring right now. This is because you need to combine it wih CSS to make it look pretty. Still, there are many things you can do with it. Here are some of them:
   <ul>
     <li>Lists</li>
       <li>Paragraphs</li>
     <li>Headings</li>
     <li>Horizontal Lines</li>
      </ul>
   <hr>
     <h3>How do you add color?</h3>
       <p>Color is easy to add. Unfortunately, you can't add it directly from the HTML library. Instead, you need to learn a seperate coding language call CSS. Using CSS you can add color and customization to your web page! There are many colors you can add
         such as red, blue, green, teal, brown, and much, MUCH more!<br>Let's get started!</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
  <p>Paragraphs are the main part of a website. They deliver the bulk of information and are SUPER IMPORTANT. For example,
  this is a paragraph.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Headings</h3>
  <p>Headings come in a few different sizes depending on what you want. Here are all the headings:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><h1>Heading 1</h1></li>
    <li><h2>Heading 2</h2></li>
    <li><h3>Heading 3</h3></li>
    <li><h4>Heading 4</h4></li>
    <li><h5>Heading 5</h5></li>
    And finally,
    <li><h6>Heading 6</h6></li>
  </ol>
  <p>As you can see, there are many different sizes of pre-set fonts. Six to be exact! You may have also noticed the smaller
  the number, the larger the text. Each size can be used for a different function. If you want to narrow your sizes down even
  more, you need to include some CSS. We'll talk about that later. Typicaly, heading 1 is only used for a title, meaning you should
  only ever use it once on your website.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Lists</h3>
  <p>Lists give the user short, quick, bulleted information. This can be great if your trying to add some space between the list
  and the paragraph. This is because it can be hard and boarding to read one huge bulk of information. So splitting it up a little 
  really helps!<br>There are two types of lists: organized lists and unorganized lists. Here is an example:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>This is an organized list</li>
    <li>This is also an organized list</li>
    <li>Organized lists are numbered</li>
  </ol>
  <p>As you can see, organized lists are numbered. This is why they are call organized. Here is an unorganized list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This is an unorganized list</li>
    <li>This is also an unorganized list</li>
    <li>Unorganized lists use bullet points instead of numbers</li>
  </ul>
